// Assuming that we are still using the array with the insertion from pop-method.js
arr.pop();
// Length = 5, capacity = 9, memory address = 5
arr.pop();
// Length = 4, capacity = 9, memory address = 4
arr.pop();
// Length = 3, capacity = 9, memory address = 3

// pop() only decreases the length without changing anything, capacity will stay the same
